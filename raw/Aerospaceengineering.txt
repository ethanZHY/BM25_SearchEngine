aerospace engineering aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft  it has two major and overlapping branches aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering avionics engineering is similar but deals with the electrical side of aerospace engineering aeronautical engineering was the original term for the field as flight technology advanced to include craft operating in outer space astronautics the broader term aerospace engineering has largely replaced it in common usage  aerospace engineering particularly the astronautics branch is often colloquially referred to as rocket science    flight vehicles are subjected to demanding conditions such as those produced by changes in atmospheric pressure and temperature with structural loads applied upon vehicle components consequently they are usually the products of various technological and engineering disciplines including aerodynamics propulsion avionics materials science structural analysis and manufacturing the interaction between these technologies is known as aerospace engineering because of the complexity and number of disciplines involved aerospace engineering is carried out by teams of engineers each having their own specialized area of expertise  the origin of aerospace engineering can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the late 19th to early 20th centuries although the work of sir george cayley dates from the last decade of the 18th to mid-19th century one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics  cayley was a pioneer in aeronautical engineering  and is credited as the first person to separate the forces of lift and drag which are in effect on any flight vehicle  early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering  scientists understood some key elements of aerospace engineering like fluid dynamics in the 18th century many years later after the successful flights by the wright brothers the 1910s saw the development of aeronautical engineering through the design of world war i military aircraft the first definition of aerospace engineering appeared in february 1958  the definition considered the earths atmosphere and the outer space as a single realm thereby encompassing both aircraft aero and spacecraft space under a newly coined word aerospace in response to the ussr launching the first satellite sputnik into space on october 4 1957 us aerospace engineers launched the first american satellite on january 31 1958 the national aeronautics and space administration was founded in 1958 as a response to the cold war  some of the elements of aerospace engineering are   the basis of most of these elements lies in theoretical physics such as fluid dynamics for aerodynamics or the equations of motion for flight dynamics there is also a large empirical component historically this empirical component was derived from testing of scale models and prototypes either in wind tunnels or in the free atmosphere more recently advances in computing have enabled the use of computational fluid dynamics to simulate the behavior of fluid reducing time and expense spent on wind-tunnel testing those studying hydrodynamics or hydroacoustics often obtained degrees in aerospace engineering additionally aerospace engineering addresses the integration of all components that constitute an aerospace vehicle subsystems including power aerospace bearings communications thermal control life support etc and its life cycle design temperature pressure radiation velocity lifetime aerospace engineering may be studied at the advanced diploma bachelors masters and phd levels in aerospace engineering departments at many universities and in mechanical engineering departments at others a few departments offer degrees in space-focused astronautical engineering some institutions differentiate between aeronautical and astronautical engineering graduate degrees are offered in advanced or specialty areas for the aerospace industry a background in chemistry physics computer science and mathematics is important for students pursuing an aerospace engineering degree  the term rocket scientist is sometimes used to describe a person of great intelligence since rocket science is seen as a practice requiring great mental ability especially technical and mathematical ability the term is used ironically in the expression its not rocket science to indicate that a task is simple  strictly speaking the use of science in rocket science is a misnomer since science is about understanding the origins nature and behavior of the universe engineering is about using scientific and engineering principles to solve problems and develop new technology   however the media and the public often use science and engineering as synonyms
