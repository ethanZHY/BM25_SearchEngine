automotive engineering automobile engineering along with aerospace engineering and marine engineering is a branch of vehicle engineering incorporating elements of mechanical electrical electronic software and safety engineering as applied to the design manufacture and operation of motorcycles automobiles and trucks and their respective engineering subsystems it also includes modification of vehicles manufacturing domain deals with the creation and assembling the whole parts of automobiles is also included in itthe automotive engineering field is research -intensive and involves direct application of mathematical models and formulas the study of automotive engineering is to design develop fabricate and testing vehicles or vehicle components from the concept stage to production stage production development and manufacturing are the three major functions in this field automobile engineering is mainly divided into three streams such as production or design engineering focuses on design components testing of parts co-ordinating tests and system of a vehicle   automobile engineering is a branch study of engineering which teaches manufacturing designing mechanical-mechanisms as well operations of automobiles it is an introduction to vehicle engineering which deals with motorcycles cars buses trucks etc it include branch study of mechanical electronic software and safety elements some of the engineering attributes and disciplines that are of importance to the automotive engineer and many of the other aspects are included in it safety engineering safety engineering is the assessment of various crash scenarios and their impact on the vehicle occupants these are tested against very stringent governmental regulations some of these requirements include seat belt and air bag functionality testing front and side impact testing and tests of rollover resistance assessments are done with various methods and tools including computer crash simulation typically finite element analysis crash test dummies and partial system sled and full vehicle crashes fuel economyemissions fuel economy is the measured fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon or kilometers per litre emissions testing includes the measurement of vehicle emissions including hydrocarbons nitrogen oxides nox carbon monoxide co carbon dioxide co2 and evaporative emissions vehicle dynamics vehicle dynamics is the vehicles response of the following attributes ride handling steering braking comfort and traction design of the chassis systems of suspension steering braking structure frame wheels and tires and traction control are highly leveraged by the vehicle dynamics engineer to deliver the vehicle dynamics qualities desired nvh engineering noise vibration and harshness nvh is the customers feedback both tactile felt and audible heard from the vehicle while sound can be interpreted as a rattle squeal or hoot a tactile response can be seat vibration or a buzz in the steering wheel this feedback is generated by components either rubbing vibrating or rotating nvh response can be classified in various ways powertrain nvh road noise wind noise component noise and squeak and rattle note there are both good and bad nvh qualities the nvh engineer works to either eliminate bad nvh or change the “bad nvh” to good ie exhaust tones vehicle electronics automotive electronics is an increasingly important aspect of automotive engineering modern vehicles employ dozens of electronic systems  these systems are responsible for operational controls such as the throttle brake and steering controls as well as many comfort and convenience systems such as the hvac infotainment and lighting systems it would not be possible for automobiles to meet modern safety and fuel economy requirements without electronic controls performance performance is a measurable and testable value of a vehicles ability to perform in various conditions performance can be considered in a wide variety of tasks but its generally associated with how quickly a car can accelerate eg standing start 14 mile elapsed time 0–60 mph etc its top speed how short and quickly a car can come to a complete stop from a set speed eg 70-0 mph how much g-force a car can generate without losing grip recorded lap times cornering speed brake fade etc performance can also reflect the amount of control in inclement weather snow ice rain shift quality shift quality is the driver’s perception of the vehicle to an automatic transmission shift event this is influenced by the powertrain engine transmission and the vehicle driveline suspension engine and powertrain mounts etc shift feel is both a tactile felt and audible heard response of the vehicle shift quality is experienced as various events transmission shifts are felt as an upshift at acceleration 1–2 or a downshift maneuver in passing 4–2 shift engagements of the vehicle are also evaluated as in park to reverse etc durability  corrosion engineering durability and corrosion engineering is the evaluation testing of a vehicle for its useful life tests include mileage accumulation severe driving conditions and corrosive salt baths package  ergonomics engineering package engineering is a discipline that designsanalyzes the occupant accommodations seat roominess ingressegress to the vehicle and the driver’s field of vision gauges and windows the package engineer is also responsible for other areas of the vehicle like the engine compartment and the component to component placement ergonomics is the discipline that assesses the occupants access to the steering wheel pedals and other driverpassenger controls climate control climate control is the customer’s impression of the cabin environment and level of comfort related to the temperature and humidity from the windshield defrosting to the heating and cooling capacity all vehicle seating positions are evaluated to a certain level of comfort drivability drivability is the vehicle’s response to general driving conditions cold starts and stalls rpm dips idle response launch hesitations and stumbles and performance levels cost the cost of a vehicle program is typically split into the effect on the variable cost of the vehicle and the up-front tooling and fixed costs associated with developing the vehicle there are also costs associated with warranty reductions and marketing program timing to some extent programs are timed with respect to the market and also to the production schedules of the assembly plants any new part in the design must support the development and manufacturing schedule of the model assembly feasibility it is easy to design a module that is hard to assemble either resulting in damaged units or poor tolerances the skilled product development engineer works with the assemblymanufacturing engineers so that the resulting design is easy and cheap to make and assemble as well as delivering appropriate functionality and appearance quality management quality control is an important factor within the production process as high quality is needed to meet customer requirements and to avoid expensive recall campaigns the complexity of components involved in the production process requires a combination of different tools and techniques for quality control therefore the international automotive task force iatf a group of the world’s leading manufacturers and trade organizations developed the standard isots 16949 this standard defines the design development production and when relevant installation and service requirements furthermore it combines the principles of iso 9001 with aspects of various regional and national automotive standards such as avsq italy eaqf france vda6 germany and qs-9000 usa in order to further minimize risks related to product failures and liability claims of automotive electric and electronic systems the quality discipline functional safety according to isoiec 17025 is applied since the 1950s the comprehensive business approach total quality management tqm helps to continuously improve the production process of automotive products and components some of the companies who have implemented tqm include ford motor company motorola and toyota motor company  a development engineer has the responsibility for coordinating delivery of the engineering attributes of a complete automobile bus car truck van suv motorcycle etc as dictated by the automobile manufacturer governmental regulations and the customer who buys the product much like the systems engineer the development engineer is concerned with the interactions of all systems in the complete automobile while there are multiple components and systems in an automobile that have to function as designed they must also work in harmony with the complete automobile as an example the brake systems main function is to provide braking functionality to the automobile along with this it must also provide an acceptable level of pedal feel spongy stiff brake system “noise” squeal shudder etc and interaction with the abs anti-lock braking system another aspect of the development engineers job is a trade-off process required to deliver all of the automobile attributes at a certain acceptable level an example of this is the trade-off between engine performance and fuel economy while some customers are looking for maximum power from their engine the automobile is still required to deliver an acceptable level of fuel economy from the engines perspective these are opposing requirements engine performance is looking for maximum displacement bigger more power while fuel economy is looking for a smaller displacement engine ex 1.4 l vs 5.4 l the engine size however is not the only contributing factor to fuel economy and automobile performance different values come into play other attributes that involve trade-offs include automobile weight aerodynamic drag transmission gearing emission control devices handlingroadholding ride quality and tires the development engineer is also responsible for organizing automobile level testing validation and certification components and systems are designed and tested individually by the product engineer the final evaluation is to be conducted at the automobile level to evaluate system to system interactions as an example the audio system radio needs to be evaluated at the automobile level interaction with other electronic components can cause interference heat dissipation of the system and ergonomic placement of the controls need to be evaluated sound quality in all seating positions needs to be provided at acceptable levels manufacturing engineers are responsible for ensuring proper production of the automotive components or complete vehicles while the development engineers are responsible for the function of the vehicle manufacturing engineers are responsible for the safe and effective production of the vehicle this group of engineers consist of process engineers logistic coordinators tooling engineers robotics engineers and assembly planners  in the automotive industry manufacturers are playing a larger role in the development stages of automotive components to ensure that the products are easy to manufacture design for manufacturability in the automotive world is crucial to make certain whichever design is developed in the research and development stage of automotive design once the design is established the manufacturing engineers take over they design the machinery and tooling necessary to build the automotive components or vehicle and establish the methods of how to mass-produce the product it is the manufacturing engineers job to increase the efficiency of the automotive plant and to implement lean manufacturing techniques such as six sigma and kaizen other automotive engineers include those listed below studies indicate that a substantial part of the modern vehicles value comes from intelligent systems and that these represent most of the current automotive innovation    to facilitate this the modern automotive engineering process has to handle an increased use of mechatronics configuration and performance optimization system integration control component subsystem and system-level validation of the intelligent systems must become an intrinsic part of the standard vehicle engineering process just as this is the case for the structural vibro-acoustic and kinematic design this requires a vehicle development process that is typically highly simulation-driven  one way to effectively deal with the inherent multi-physics and the control systems development that is involved when including intelligent systems is to adopt the v-model approach to systems development as has been widely used in the automotive industry for twenty years or more in this v-approach system-level requirements are propagated down the v via subsystems to component design and the system performance is validated at increasing integration levels engineering of mechatronic systems requires the application of two interconnected “v-cycles” one focusing on the multi-physics system engineering like the mechanical and electrical components of an electrically powered steering system including sensors and actuators and the other focuses on the controls engineering the control logic the software and realization of the control hardware and embedded software   an alternative approach is called predictive engineering analytics and takes the v-approach to the next level it lets design continue after product delivery that is important for development of built-in predictive functionality and for creating vehicles that can be optimized while being in use even based on real use data this approach is based on the creation of a digital twin a replica of the real product that remains in-sync manufacturers try to achieve this by implementing a set of development tactics and tools critical is a strong alignment of 1d systems simulation 3d cae an physical testing to reach more realism in the simulation process this is combined with intelligent reporting and data analytics for better insight in the vehicle use by supporting this with a strong data management structure that spans the entire product lifecycle they bridge the gap between design manufacturing and product use
