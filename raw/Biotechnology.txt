biotechnology biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products or any technological application that uses biological systems living organisms or derivatives thereof to make or modify products or processes for specific use un convention on biological diversity art 2  depending on the tools and applications it often overlaps with the related fields of bioengineering biomedical engineering biomanufacturing molecular engineering etc for thousands of years humankind has used biotechnology in agriculture food production and medicine  the term is largely believed to have been coined in 1919 by hungarian engineer károly ereky in the late 20th and early 21st centuries biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse sciences such as genomics recombinant gene techniques applied immunology and development of pharmaceutical therapies and diagnostic tests    the wide concept of biotech or biotechnology encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms according to human purposes going back to domestication of animals cultivation of the plants and improvements to these through breeding programs that employ artificial selection and hybridization modern usage also includes genetic engineering as well as cell and tissue culture technologies the american chemical society defines biotechnology as the application of biological organisms systems or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and the improvement of the value of materials and organisms such as pharmaceuticals crops and livestock  as per european federation of biotechnology biotechnology is the integration of natural science and organisms cells parts thereof and molecular analogues for products and services  biotechnology also writes on the pure biological sciences animal cell culture biochemistry cell biology embryology genetics microbiology and molecular biology in many instances it is also dependent on knowledge and methods from outside the sphere of biology including conversely modern biological sciences including even concepts such as molecular ecology are intimately entwined and heavily dependent on the methods developed through biotechnology and what is commonly thought of as the life sciences industry biotechnology is the research and development in the laboratory using bioinformatics for exploration extraction exploitation and production from any living organisms and any source of biomass by means of biochemical engineering where high value-added products could be planned reproduced by biosynthesis for example forecasted formulated developed manufactured and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations for the return from bottomless initial investment on r  d and gaining durable patents rights for exclusives rights for sales and prior to this to receive national and international approval from the results on animal experiment and human experiment especially on the pharmaceutical branch of biotechnology to prevent any undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products    by contrast bioengineering is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches not necessarily the altering or using of biological materials directly for interfacing with and utilizing living things bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and natural sciences to tissues cells and molecules this can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals  relatedly biomedical engineering is an overlapping field that often draws upon and applies biotechnology by various definitions especially in certain sub-fields of biomedical andor chemical engineering such as tissue engineering biopharmaceutical engineering and genetic engineering although not normally what first comes to mind many forms of human-derived agriculture clearly fit the broad definition of utilizing a biotechnological system to make products indeed the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the neolithic revolution through early biotechnology the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops having the highest yields to produce enough food to support a growing population as crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively fertilize restore nitrogen and control pests throughout the history of agriculture farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology these processes also were included in early fermentation of beer  these processes were introduced in early mesopotamia egypt china and india and still use the same basic biological methods in brewing malted grains containing enzymes convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to produce beer in this process carbohydrates in the grains were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol later other cultures produced the process of lactic acid fermentation which allowed the fermentation and preservation of other forms of food such as soy sauce fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until louis pasteurs work in 1857 it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form before the time of charles darwins work and life animal and plant scientists had already used selective breeding darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species these accounts contributed to darwins theory of natural selection  for thousands of years humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food in selective breeding organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics for example this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops  in the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of microbiology and explored ways of manufacturing specific products in 1917 chaim weizmann first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process that of manufacturing corn starch using clostridium acetobutylicum to produce acetone which the united kingdom desperately needed to manufacture explosives during world war i  biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics in 1928 alexander fleming discovered the mold penicillium his work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by howard florey ernst boris chain and norman heatley – to form what we today know as penicillin in 1940 penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans  the field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when paul bergs stanford experiments in gene splicing had early success herbert w boyer univ calif at san francisco and stanley n cohen stanford significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium such that the imported material would be reproduced the commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was significantly expanded on june 16 1980 when the united states supreme court ruled that a genetically modified microorganism could be patented in the case of diamond v chakrabarty  indian-born ananda chakrabarty working for general electric had modified a bacterium of the pseudomonas genus capable of breaking down crude oil which he proposed to use in treating oil spills chakrabartys work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer of entire organelles between strains of the pseudomonas bacterium revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008 another factor influencing the biotechnology sectors success is improved intellectual property rights legislation—and enforcement—worldwide as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing and ailing us population  rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector with the department of energy estimating ethanol usage could reduce us petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030 the biotechnology sector has allowed the us farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought by boosting farm productivity biotechnology plays a crucial role in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met  biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas including health care medical crop production and agriculture non food industrial uses of crops and other products eg biodegradable plastics vegetable oil biofuels and environmental uses for example one application of biotechnology is the directed use of organisms for the manufacture of organic products examples include beer and milk products another example is using naturally present bacteria by the mining industry in bioleaching biotechnology is also used to recycle treat waste clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities bioremediation and also to produce biological weapons a series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology for example the investment and economic output of all of these types of applied biotechnologies is termed as bioeconomy in medicine modern biotechnology finds applications in areas such as pharmaceutical drug discovery and production pharmacogenomics and genetic testing or genetic screening pharmacogenomics a combination of pharmacology and genomics is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individuals response to drugs  it deals with the influence of genetic variation on drug response in patients by correlating gene expression or single-nucleotide polymorphisms with a drugs efficacy or toxicity  by doing so pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy with respect to the patients genotype to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects  such approaches promise the advent of personalized medicine in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individuals unique genetic makeup   biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional small molecule pharmaceutical drugs as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – biopharmaceutics modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply the first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases to cite one example in 1978 genentech developed synthetic humanized insulin by joining its gene with a plasmid vector inserted into the bacterium escherichia coli insulin widely used for the treatment of diabetes was previously extracted from the pancreas of abattoir animals cattle andor pigs the resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost   biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like gene therapy the application of biotechnology to basic science for example through the human genome project has also dramatically improved our understanding of biology and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well  genetic testing allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases and can also be used to determine a childs parentage genetic mother and father or in general a persons ancestry in addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes genes or proteins  most of the time testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders the results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a persons chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder as of 2011 several hundred genetic tests were in use   since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counseling genetically modified crops gm crops or biotech crops are plants used in agriculture the dna of which has been modified with genetic engineering techniques in most cases the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests  diseases  stressful environmental conditions  resistance to chemical treatments eg resistance to a herbicide  reduction of spoilage  or improving the nutrient profile of the crop  examples in non-food crops include production of pharmaceutical agents  biofuels  and other industrially useful goods  as well as for bioremediation   farmers have widely adopted gm technology between 1996 and 2011 the total surface area of land cultivated with gm crops had increased by a factor of 94 from 17,000 square kilometers 4,200,000 acres to 1,600,000 km  395 million acres  10% of the worlds crop lands were planted with gm crops in 2010  as of 2011 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395 million acres 160 million hectares in 29 countries such as the usa brazil argentina india canada china paraguay pakistan south africa uruguay bolivia australia philippines myanmar burkina faso mexico and spain  genetically modified foods are foods produced from organisms that have had specific changes introduced into their dna with the methods of genetic engineering these techniques have allowed for the introduction of new crop traits as well as a far greater control over a foods genetic structure than previously afforded by methods such as selective breeding and mutation breeding  commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994 when calgene first marketed its flavr savr delayed ripening tomato  to date most genetic modification of foods have primarily focused on cash crops in high demand by farmers such as soybean corn canola and cotton seed oil these have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and better nutrient profiles gm livestock have also been experimentally developed although as of november 2013 none are currently on the market  there is a scientific consensus     that currently available food derived from gm crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food      but that each gm food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction    nonetheless members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive gm foods as safe     the legal and regulatory status of gm foods varies by country with some nations banning or restricting them and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation     gm crops also provide a number of ecological benefits if not used in excess  however opponents have objected to gm crops per se on several grounds including environmental concerns whether food produced from gm crops is safe whether gm crops are needed to address the worlds food needs and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law industrial biotechnology known mainly in europe as white biotechnology is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes including industrial fermentation it includes the practice of using cells such as micro-organisms or components of cells like enzymes to generate industrially useful products in sectors such as chemicals food and feed detergents paper and pulp textiles and biofuels  in doing so biotechnology uses renewable raw materials and may contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy  the environment can be affected by biotechnologies both positively and adversely vallero and others have argued that the difference between beneficial biotechnology eg bioremediation to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological enterprises eg flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains can be seen as applications and implications respectively  cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of environmental biotechnology whereas loss of biodiversity or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnology the regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of genetic engineering technology and the development and release of genetically modified organisms gmo including genetically modified crops and genetically modified fish there are differences in the regulation of gmos between countries with some of the most marked differences occurring between the usa and europe  regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering for example a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety  the european union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the eu and approval for import and processing while only a few gmos have been approved for cultivation in the eu a number of gmos have been approved for import and processing  the cultivation of gmos has triggered a debate about coexistence of gm and non gm crops depending on the coexistence regulations incentives for cultivation of gm crops differ  in 1988 after prompting from the united states congress the national institute of general medical sciences national institutes of health nigms instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish biotechnology training programs btps each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed graduate students in turn compete for acceptance into a btp if accepted then stipend tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their phd thesis work nineteen institutions offer nigms supported btps  biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges the literature about biodiversity and the ge foodfeed consumption has sometimes resulted in animated debate regarding the suitability of the experimental designs the choice of the statistical methods or the public accessibility of data such debate even if positive and part of the natural process of review by the scientific community has frequently been distorted by the media and often used politically and inappropriately in anti-ge crops campaigns  domingo josé l bordonaba jordi giné 2011 a literature review on the safety assessment of genetically modified plants pdf environment international 37 734–742 doi:10.1016jenvint.2011.01.003 pmid 21296423 in spite of this the number of studies specifically focused on safety assessment of gm plants is still limited however it is important to remark that for the first time a certain equilibrium in the number of research groups suggesting on the basis of their studies that a number of varieties of gm products mainly maize and soybeans are as safe and nutritious as the respective conventional non-gm plant and those raising still serious concerns was observed moreover it is worth mentioning that most of the studies demonstrating that gm foods are as nutritional and safe as those obtained by conventional breeding have been performed by biotechnology companies or associates which are also responsible of commercializing these gm plants anyhow this represents a notable advance in comparison with the lack of studies published in recent years in scientific journals by those companies  krimsky sheldon

pmid 26767435 here we show that a number of articles some of which have strongly and negatively influenced the public opinion on gm crops and even provoked political actions such as gmo embargo share common flaws in the statistical evaluation of the data having accounted for these flaws we conclude that the data presented in these articles does not provide any substantial evidence of gmo harm the presented articles suggesting possible harm of gmos received high public attention however despite their claims they actually weaken the evidence for the harm and lack of substantial equivalency of studied gmos we emphasize that with over 1783 published articles on gmos over the last 10 years it is expected that some of them should have reported undesired differences between gmos and conventional crops even if no such differences exist in reality  and yang yt chen b 2016 governing gmos in the usa science law and public health journal of the science of food and agriculture 96

2011 overall a broad scientific consensus holds that currently marketed gm food poses no greater risk than conventional food major national and international science and medical associations have stated that no adverse human health effects related to gmo food have been reported or substantiated in peer-reviewed literature to date despite various concerns today the american association for the advancement of science the world health organization and many independent international science organizations agree that gmos are just as safe as other foods compared with conventional breeding techniques genetic engineering is far more precise and in most cases less likely to create an unexpected outcome  pinholster ginger october 25 2012 aaas board of directors legally mandating gm food

adequate post market monitoring should form the basis for ensuring the safety of gm foods  genetically modified foods and health a second interim statement pdf british medical association march 2004 retrieved march 21 2016 in our view the potential for gm foods to cause harmful health effects is very small and many of the concerns expressed apply with equal vigour to conventionally derived foods however safety concerns cannot as yet be dismissed completely on the basis of information currently available when seeking to optimise the balance between benefits and risks it is prudent to err on the side of caution and above all learn from accumulating knowledge and experience any new technology such as genetic modification must be examined for possible benefits and risks to human health and the environment as with all novel foods safety assessments in relation to gm foods must be made on a case-by-case basis members of the gm jury project were briefed on various aspects of genetic modification by a diverse group of acknowledged experts in the relevant subjects the gm jury reached the conclusion that the sale of gm foods currently available should be halted and the moratorium on commercial growth of gm crops should be continued these conclusions were based on the precautionary principle and lack of evidence of any benefit the jury expressed concern over the impact of gm crops on farming the environment food safety and other potential health effects the royal society review 2002 concluded that the risks to human health associated with the use of specific viral dna sequences in gm plants are negligible and while calling for caution in the introduction of potential allergens into food crops stressed the absence of evidence that commercially available gm foods cause clinical allergic manifestations the bma shares the view that that there is no robust evidence to prove that gm foods are unsafe but we endorse the call for further research and surveillance to provide convincing evidence of safety and benefit
