ai research defines itself as the study of intelligent agents any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal  colloquially the term artificial intelligence is applied when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with other human minds such as learning and problem solving known as machine learning  as machines become increasingly capable mental facilities once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition for instance optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an example of artificial intelligence having become a routine technology  capabilities currently classified as ai include successfully understanding human speech  competing at a high level in strategic game systems such as chess and go  self-driving cars intelligent routing in content delivery networks and interpreting complex data ai research is divided into subfields  that focus on specific problems or on specific approaches or on the use of a particular tool or towards satisfying particular applications the central problems or goals of ai research include reasoning knowledge planning learning natural language processing communication perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects  general intelligence is among the fields long-term goals  approaches include statistical methods computational intelligence and traditional symbolic ai many tools are used in ai including versions of search and mathematical optimization logic methods based on probability and economics the ai field draws upon computer science mathematics psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and artificial psychology the field was founded on the claim that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it  this raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence issues which have been explored by myth fiction and philosophy since antiquity  some people also consider ai a danger to humanity if it progresses unabatedly  attempts to create artificial intelligence have experienced many setbacks including the alpac report of 1966 the abandonment of perceptrons in 1970 the lighthill report of 1973 the second ai winter 1987–1993 and the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 in the twenty-first century ai techniques both hard and soft have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power sizes of training sets and theoretical understanding and ai techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science  while thought-capable artificial beings appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity  the idea of actually trying to build a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with ramon llull c 1300 ce with his calculus ratiocinator gottfried leibniz extended the concept of the calculating machine wilhelm schickard engineered the first one around 1623 intending to perform operations on concepts rather than numbers  since the 19th century artificial beings are common in fiction as in mary shelleys frankenstein or karel čapeks ru r rossums universal robots  the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity in the 19th century george boole refined those ideas into propositional logic and gottlob frege developed a notational system for mechanical reasoning a predicate calculus  around the 1940s alan turings theory of computation suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as 0 and 1 could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction this insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the church–turing thesis   along with concurrent discoveries in neurology information theory and cybernetics this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain  the first work that is now generally recognized as ai was mccullouch and pitts 1943 formal design for turing-complete artificial neurons  the field of ai research was born  at a conference at dartmouth college in 1956  attendees allen newell cmu herbert simon cmu john mccarthy mit marvin minsky mit and arthur samuel ibm became the founders and leaders of ai research  at the conference newell and simon together with programmer j c shaw rand presented the first true artificial intelligence program the logic theorist this spurred tremendous research in the domain  computers were winning at checkers solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english  by the middle of the 1960s research in the us was heavily funded by the department of defense  and laboratories had been established around the world  ais founders were optimistic about the future herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do marvin minsky agreed writing within a generationus the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved  they failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks progress slowed and in 1974 in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill  and ongoing pressure from the us congress to fund more productive projects both the us and british governments cut off exploratory research in ai the next few years would later be called an ai winter  a period when funding for ai projects was hard to find in the early 1980s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems  a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts by 1985 the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the us and british governments to restore funding for academic research  however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in 1987 ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longer-lasting hiatus began  in the late 1990s and early 21st century ai began to be used for logistics data mining medical diagnosis and other areas  the success was due to increasing computational power see moores law greater emphasis on solving specific problems new ties between ai and other fields and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards  deep blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on 11 may 1997  advanced statistical techniques loosely known as deep learning access to large amounts of data and faster computers enabled advances in machine learning and perception  by the mid 2010s machine learning applications were used throughout the world  in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibms question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin  the kinect which provides a 3d body–motion interface for the xbox 360 and the xbox one use algorithms that emerged from lengthy ai research  as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones  in march 2016 alphago won 4 out of 5 games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer go-playing system to beat a professional go player without handicaps   according to bloombergs jack clark 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence with the number of software projects that use ai within google increasing from a sporadic usage in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects clark also presents factual data indicating that error rates in image processing tasks have fallen significantly since 2011  he attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets other cited examples include microsofts development of a skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and facebooks system that can describe images to blind people  the overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display the traits described below have received the most attention  erik sandwell emphasizes planning and learning that is relevant and applicable to the given situation  early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions reason  by the late 1980s and 1990s ai research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics  for difficult problems algorithms can require enormous computational resources—most experience a combinatorial explosion the amount of memory or computer time required becomes astronomical for problems of a certain size the search for more efficient problem-solving algorithms is a high priority  human beings ordinarily use fast intuitive judgments rather than step-by-step deduction that early ai research was able to model  ai has progressed using sub-symbolic problem solving embodied agent approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor skills to higher reasoning neural net research attempts to simulate the structures inside the brain that give rise to this skill statistical approaches to ai mimic the human ability knowledge representation  and knowledge engineering  are central to ai research many of the problems machines are expected to solve will require extensive knowledge about the world among the things that ai needs to represent are objects properties categories and relations between objects  situations events states and time  causes and effects  knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know  and many other less well researched domains a representation of what exists is an ontology the set of objects relations concepts and so on that the machine knows about the most general are called upper ontologies which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge  among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them  they need a way to visualize the future they must have a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it and be able to make choices that maximize the utility or value of the available choices  in classical planning problems the agent can assume that it is the only thing acting on the world and it can be certain what the consequences of its actions may be  however if the agent is not the only actor it must periodically ascertain whether the world matches its predictions and it must change its plan as this becomes necessary requiring the agent to reason under uncertainty  multi-agent planning uses the cooperation and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal emergent behavior such as this is used by evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence  machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience   and has been central to ai research since the fields inception  unsupervised learning is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input supervised learning includes both classification and numerical regression classification is used to determine what category something belongs in after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change in reinforcement learning  the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones the agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space these three types of learning can be analyzed in terms of decision theory using concepts like utility the mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory  within developmental robotics developmental learning approaches were elaborated for lifelong cumulative acquisition of repertoires of novel skills by a robot through autonomous self-exploration and social interaction with human teachers and using guidance mechanisms such as active learning maturation motor synergies and imitation     natural language processing  gives machines the ability to read and understand the languages that humans speak a sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources such as newswire texts some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval text mining question answering  and machine translation  a common method of processing and extracting meaning from natural language is through semantic indexing increases in processing speeds and the drop in the cost of data storage makes indexing large volumes of abstractions of the users input much more efficient machine perception  is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones tactile sensors sonar and others more exotic to deduce aspects of the world computer vision  is the ability to analyze visual input a few selected subproblems are speech recognition  facial recognition and object recognition  the field of robotics  is closely related to ai intelligence is required for robots to be able to handle such tasks as object manipulation  and navigation with sub-problems of localization knowing where you are or finding out where other things are mapping learning what is around you building a map of the environment and motion planning figuring out how to get there or path planning going from one point in space to another point which may involve compliant motion – where the robot moves while maintaining physical contact with an object   affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize interpret process and simulate human affects   it is an interdisciplinary field spanning computer sciences psychology and cognitive science  while the origins of the field may be traced as far back as to early philosophical inquiries into emotion  the more modern branch of computer science originated with rosalind picards 1995 paper  on affective computing   a motivation for the research is the ability to simulate empathy the machine should interpret the emotional state of humans and adapt its behaviour to them giving an appropriate response for those emotions emotion and social skills  play two roles for an intelligent agent first it must be able to predict the actions of others by understanding their motives and emotional states this involves elements of game theory decision theory as well as the ability to model human emotions and the perceptual skills to detect emotions also in an effort to facilitate human-computer interaction an intelligent machine might want to be able to display emotions—even if it does not actually experience them itself—in order to appear sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction a sub-field of ai addresses creativity both theoretically from a philosophical and psychological perspective and practically via specific implementations of systems that generate outputs that can be considered creative or systems that identify and assess creativity related areas of computational research are artificial intuition and artificial thinking many researchers think that their work will eventually be incorporated into a machine with artificial general intelligence combining all the skills above and exceeding human abilities at most or all of them   a few believe that anthropomorphic features like artificial consciousness or an artificial brain may be required for such a project   many of the problems above may require general intelligence to be considered solved for example even a straightforward specific task like machine translation requires that the machine read and write in both languages nlp follow the authors argument reason know what is being talked about knowledge and faithfully reproduce the authors intention social intelligence a problem like machine translation is considered ai-complete in order to reach human-level performance for machines one must solve all the problems  there is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides ai research researchers disagree about many issues  a few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurology? or is human biology as irrelevant to ai research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering?  can intelligent behavior be described using simple elegant principles such as logic or optimization? or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?  can intelligence be reproduced using high-level symbols similar to words and ideas? or does it require sub-symbolic processing?  john haugeland who coined the term gofai good old-fashioned artificial intelligence also proposed that ai should more properly be referred to as synthetic intelligence  a term which has since been adopted by some non-gofai researchers   stuart shapiro divides ai research into three approaches which he calls computational psychology computational philosophy and computer science computational psychology is used to make computer programs that mimic human behavior  computational philosophy is used to develop an adaptive free-flowing computer mind  implementing computer science serves the goal of creating computers that can perform tasks that only people could previously accomplish  together the humanesque behavior mind and actions make up artificial intelligence in the 1940s and 1950s a number of researchers explored the connection between neurology information theory and cybernetics some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence such as w grey walters turtles and the johns hopkins beast many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the teleological society at princeton university and the ratio club in england  by 1960 this approach was largely abandoned although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s when access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s ai research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation the research was centered in three institutions carnegie mellon university stanford and mit and each one developed its own style of research john haugeland named these approaches to ai good old fashioned ai or gofai  during the 1960s symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs approaches based on cybernetics or neural networks were abandoned or pushed into the background  researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field by the 1980s progress in symbolic ai seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition a number of researchers began to look into sub-symbolic approaches to specific ai problems  sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge in the 1990s ai researchers developed sophisticated mathematical tools to solve specific subproblems these tools are truly scientific in the sense that their results are both measurable and verifiable and they have been responsible for many of ais recent successes the shared mathematical language has also permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields like mathematics economics or operations research stuart russell and peter norvig describe this movement as nothing less than a revolution and the victory of the neats  critics argue that these techniques with few exceptions  are too focused on particular problems and have failed to address the long-term goal of general intelligence  there is an ongoing debate about the relevance and validity of statistical approaches in ai exemplified in part by exchanges between peter norvig and noam chomsky   in the course of 50 years of research ai has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science a few of the most general of these methods are discussed below many problems in ai can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions  reasoning can be reduced to performing a search for example logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions where each step is the application of an inference rule  planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called means-ends analysis  robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space  many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization simple exhaustive searches  are rarely sufficient for most real world problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers the result is a search that is too slow or never completes the solution for many problems is to use heuristics or rules of thumb that eliminate choices that are unlikely to lead to the goal called pruning the search tree heuristics supply the program with a best guess for the path on which the solution lies  heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size  a very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s based on the mathematical theory of optimization for many problems it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made these algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing we begin the search at a random point on the landscape and then by jumps or steps we keep moving our guess uphill until we reach the top other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing beam search and random optimization  evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search for example they may begin with a population of organisms the guesses and then allow them to mutate and recombine selecting only the fittest to survive each generation refining the guesses forms of evolutionary computation include swarm intelligence algorithms such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization  and evolutionary algorithms such as genetic algorithms gene expression programming and genetic programming  logic  is used for knowledge representation and problem solving but it can be applied to other problems as well for example the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning  and inductive logic programming is a method for learning  several different forms of logic are used in ai research propositional or sentential logic  is the logic of statements which can be true or false first-order logic  also allows the use of quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects their properties and their relations with each other fuzzy logic  is a version of first-order logic which allows the truth of a statement to be represented as a value between 0 and 1 rather than simply true 1 or false 0 fuzzy systems can be used for uncertain reasoning and have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems subjective logic  models uncertainty in a different and more explicit manner than fuzzy-logic a given binomial opinion satisfies belief  disbelief  uncertainty  1 within a beta distribution by this method ignorance can be distinguished from probabilistic statements that an agent makes with high confidence default logics non-monotonic logics and circumscription  are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge such as description logics  situation calculus event calculus and fluent calculus for representing events and time  causal calculus  belief calculus  and modal logics  many problems in ai in reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information ai researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics  bayesian networks  are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm  learning using the expectation-maximization algorithm  planning using decision networks  and perception using dynamic bayesian networks  probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time eg hidden markov models or kalman filters  a key concept from the science of economics is utility a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis  and information value theory  these tools include models such as markov decision processes  dynamic decision networks  game theory and mechanism design  the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers if shiny then diamond and controllers if shiny then pick up controllers do however also classify conditions before inferring actions and therefore classification forms a central part of many ai systems classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine a closest match they can be tuned according to examples making them very attractive for use in ai these examples are known as observations or patterns in supervised learning each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class a class can be seen as a decision that has to be made all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience  a classifier can be trained in various ways there are many statistical and machine learning approaches the most widely used classifiers are the neural network  kernel methods such as the support vector machine  k-nearest neighbor algorithm  gaussian mixture model  naive bayes classifier  and decision tree  the performance of these classifiers have been compared over a wide range of tasks classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified there is no single classifier that works best on all given problems this is also referred to as the no free lunch theorem determining a suitable classifier for a given problem is still more an art than science  the study of non-learning artificial neural networks  began in the decade before the field of ai research was founded in the work of walter pitts and warren mccullouch frank rosenblatt invented the perceptron a learning network with a single layer similar to the old concept of linear regression early pioneers also include alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko teuvo kohonen stephen grossberg kunihiko fukushima christoph von der malsburg david willshaw shun-ichi amari bernard widrow john hopfield eduardo r caianiello and others the main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks where the signal passes in only one direction and recurrent neural networks which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks  neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control for robotics or learning using such techniques as hebbian learning gmdh or competitive learning  today neural networks are often trained by the backpropagation algorithm which had been around since 1970 as the reverse mode of automatic differentiation published by seppo linnainmaa   and was introduced to neural networks by paul werbos    hierarchical temporal memory is an approach that models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex  deep learning in artificial neural networks with many layers has transformed many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing and others    according to a survey  the expression deep learning was introduced to the machine learning community by rina dechter in 1986  and gained traction after igor aizenberg and colleagues introduced it to artificial neural networks in 2000  the first functional deep learning networks were published by alexey grigorevich ivakhnenko and v g lapa in 1965   these networks are trained one layer at a time ivakhnenkos 1971 paper  describes the learning of a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers already much deeper than many later networks in 2006 a publication by geoffrey hinton and ruslan salakhutdinov introduced another way of pre-training many-layered feedforward neural networks fnns one layer at a time treating each layer in turn as an unsupervised restricted boltzmann machine then using supervised backpropagation for fine-tuning  similar to shallow artificial neural networks deep neural networks can model complex non-linear relationships over the last few years advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer  deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks cnns whose origins can be traced back to the neocognitron introduced by kunihiko fukushima in 1980  in 1989 yann lecun and colleagues applied backpropagation to such an architecture in the early 2000s in an industrial application cnns already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the us  since 2011 fast implementations of cnns on gpus have won many visual pattern recognition competitions  deep feedforward neural networks were used in conjunction with reinforcement learning by alphago google deepminds program that was the first to beat a professional human player  early on deep learning was also applied to sequence learning with recurrent neural networks rnns  which are general computers and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs the depth of an rnn is unlimited and depends on the length of its input sequence  rnns can be trained by gradient descent    but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem   in 1992 it was shown that unsupervised pre-training of a stack of recurrent neural networks can speed up subsequent supervised learning of deep sequential problems  numerous researchers now use variants of a deep learning recurrent nn called the long short-term memory lstm network published by hochreiter  schmidhuber in 1997  lstm is often trained by connectionist temporal classification ctc  at google microsoft and baidu this approach has revolutionised speech recognition    for example in 2015 googles speech recognition experienced a dramatic performance jump of 49% through ctc-trained lstm which is now available through google voice to billions of smartphone users  google also used lstm to improve machine translation  language modeling  and multilingual language processing  lstm combined with cnns also improved automatic image captioning  and a plethora of other applications control theory the grandchild of cybernetics has many important applications especially in robotics  ai researchers have developed several specialized languages for ai research including lisp  and prolog  in 1950 alan turing proposed a general procedure to test the intelligence of an agent now known as the turing test this procedure allows almost all the major problems of artificial intelligence to be tested however it is a very difficult challenge and at present all agents fail  artificial intelligence can also be evaluated on specific problems such as small problems in chemistry hand-writing recognition and game-playing such tests have been termed subject matter expert turing tests smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results  for example performance at draughts ie checkers is optimal  performance at chess is high-human and nearing super-human see computer chess computers versus human and performance at many everyday tasks such as recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into something is sub-human a quite different approach measures machine intelligence through tests which are developed from mathematical definitions of intelligence examples of these kinds of tests start in the late nineties devising intelligence tests using notions from kolmogorov complexity and data compression  two major advantages of mathematical definitions are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers a derivative of the turing test is the completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart captcha as the name implies this helps to determine that a user is an actual person and not a computer posing as a human in contrast to the standard turing test captcha administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine a computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test computers are unable to solve the problem so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test a common type of captcha is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer  ai is relevant to any intellectual task  modern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here frequently when a technique reaches mainstream use it is no longer considered artificial intelligence this phenomenon is described as the ai effect  high-profile examples of ai include autonomous vehicles such as drones and self-driving cars medical diagnosis creating art such as poetry proving mathematical theorems playing games such as chess or go search engines such as google search online assistants such as siri image recognition in photographs spam filtering prediction of judicial decisions  and targeting online advertisements    with social media sites overtaking tv as a source for news for young people and news organisations increasingly reliant on social media platforms for generating distribution  major publishers now use artificial intelligence ai technology to post stories more effectively and generate higher volumes of traffic  there are a number of competitions and prizes to promote research in artificial intelligence the main areas promoted are general machine intelligence conversational behavior data-mining robotic cars robot soccer and games artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors according to bloomberg technology microsoft has developed ai to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer   there is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer in detail there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer this negatively affects the doctors because there are way too many options to choose from making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients microsoft is working on a project to develop a machine called hanover its goal is to memorize all the papers necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient one project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia a fatal cancer where the treatment has not improved in decades another study was reported to have found that artificial intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers  another study is using artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients and this is done by asking each patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions  according to cnn there was a recent study by surgeons at the childrens national medical center in washington which successfully demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot the team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery stitching together a pigs bowel during open surgery and doing so better than a human surgeon the team claimed  advancements in ai have contributed to the growth of the automotive industry through the creation and evolution of self-driving vehicles as of 2016 there are over 30 companies utilizing ai into the creation of driverless cars a few companies involved with ai include tesla google and apple  many components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars these vehicles incorporate systems such as braking lane changing collision prevention navigation and mapping together these systems as well as high performance computers are integrated into one complex vehicle  one main factor that influences the ability for a driver-less car to function is mapping in general the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven this map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings however google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings  some self-driving cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions  financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm flagging these for human investigation use of ai in banking can be tracked back to 1987 when security pacific national bank in usa set-up a fraud prevention task force to counter the unauthorised use of debit cards apps like kasisito and moneystream are using ai in financial services banks use artificial intelligence systems to organize operations maintain book-keeping invest in stocks and manage properties ai can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place  in august 2001 robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition  ai has also reduced fraud and crime by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any changes or anomalies  a platform or computing platform is defined as some sort of hardware architecture or software framework including application frameworks that allows software to run as rodney brooks pointed out many years ago  it is not just the artificial intelligence software that defines the ai features of the platform but rather the actual platform itself that affects the ai that results ie there needs to be work in ai problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation a wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of ai to develop ranging from expert systems such as cyc to deep-learning frameworks to robot platforms such as the roomba with open interface  recent advances in deep artificial neural networks and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries including deeplearning4j tensorflow theano and torch amazon google facebook ibm and microsoft have established a non-profit partnership to formulate best practices on artificial intelligence technologies advance the publics understanding and to serve as a platform about artificial intelligence  they stated this partnership on ai will conduct research organize discussions provide thought leadership consult with relevant third parties respond to questions from the public and media and create educational material that advance the understanding of ai technologies including machine perception learning and automated reasoning  apple joined other tech companies as a founding member of the partnership on ai in january 2017 the corporate members will make financial and research contributions to the group while engaging with the scientific community to bring academics onto the board  there are three philosophical questions related to ai can a machine be intelligent? can it think? widespread use of artificial intelligence could have unintended consequences that are dangerous or undesirable scientists from the future of life institute among others described some short-term research goals to be how ai influences the economy the laws and ethics that are involved with ai and how to minimize ai security risks in the long-term the scientists have proposed to continue optimizing function while minimizing possible security risks that come along with new technologies  machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions research in this area includes machine ethics artificial moral agents and the study of malevolent vs friendly ai the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race once humans develop artificial intelligence it will take off on its own and redesign itself at an ever-increasing rate humans who are limited by slow biological evolution couldnt compete and would be superseded a common concern about the development of artificial intelligence is the potential threat it could pose to mankind this concern has recently gained attention after mentions by celebrities including stephen hawking bill gates  and elon musk  a group of prominent tech titans including peter thiel amazon web services and musk have committed $1billion to openai a nonprofit company aimed at championing responsible ai development  the opinion of experts within the field of artificial intelligence is mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable ai  in his book superintelligence nick bostrom provides an argument that artificial intelligence will pose a threat to mankind he argues that sufficiently intelligent ai if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down if this ais goals do not reflect humanitys - one example is an ai told to compute as many digits of pi as possible - it might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down ultimately to better achieve its goal for this danger to be realized the hypothetical ai would have to overpower or out-think all of humanity which a minority of experts argue is a possibility far enough in the future to not be worth researching   other counterarguments revolve around humans being either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence  concern over risk from artificial intelligence has led to some high-profile donations and investments in january 2015 elon musk donated ten million dollars to the future of life institute to fund research on understanding ai decision making the goal of the institute is to grow wisdom with which we manage the growing power of technology musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as google deepmind and vicarious to just keep an eye on whats going on with artificial intelligence  i think there is potentially a dangerous outcome there   development of militarized artificial intelligence is a related concern currently 50 countries are researching battlefield robots including the united states china russia and the united kingdom many people concerned about risk from superintelligent ai also want to limit the use of artificial soldiers  joseph weizenbaum wrote that ai applications can not by definition successfully simulate genuine human empathy and that the use of ai technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy  was deeply misguided weizenbaum was also bothered that ai researchers and some philosophers were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program a position now known as computationalism to weizenbaum these points suggest that ai research devalues human life  martin ford author of the lights in the tunnel automation accelerating technology and the economy of the future  and others argue that specialized artificial intelligence applications robotics and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant unemployment as machines begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine and repetitive jobs ford predicts that many knowledge-based occupations—and in particular entry level jobs—will be increasingly susceptible to automation via expert systems machine learning  and other ai-enhanced applications ai-based applications may also be used to amplify the capabilities of low-wage offshore workers making it more feasible to outsource knowledge work   this raises the issue of how ethically the machine should behave towards both humans and other ai agents this issue was addressed by wendell wallach in his book titled moral machines in which he introduced the concept of artificial moral agents ama  for wallach amas have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as does humanity want computers making moral decisions  and can robots really be moral  for wallach the question is not centered on the issue of whether machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the constraints which society may place on the development of amas  the field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making  the field was delineated in the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines in all cases only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning the time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy necessitate this in contrast to computer hacking software property issues privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence further investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories advancing our thinking about ethics  machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality computational ethics or computational morality a variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition machine ethics  that stems from the aaai fall 2005 symposium on machine ethics  political scientist charles t rubin believes that ai can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent  he argues that any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality which has evolved along with our particular biology which ais would not share hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of mankind and would be extremely difficult to stop this topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization humans and planet earth physicist stephen hawking microsoft founder bill gates and spacex founder elon musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that ai could evolve to the point that humans could not control it with hawking theorizing that this could spell the end of the human race  one proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent ai is friendly ai and will then be able to control subsequently developed ais some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place leading ai researcher rodney brooks writes i think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent ai anytime in the next few hundred years i think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of ai and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence  if an ai system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence will that system also be sentient – will it have a mind which has conscious experiences? this question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness generally referred to as the hard problem of consciousness computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind or the human brain or both is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing  computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam the philosophical position that john searle has named strong ai states the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds  searle counters this assertion with his chinese room argument which asks us to look inside the computer and try to find where the mind might be  mary shelleys frankenstein considers a key issue in the ethics of artificial intelligence if a machine can be created that has intelligence could it also feel? if it can feel does it have the same rights as a human? the idea also appears in modern science fiction such as the film ai. artificial intelligence in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions this issue now known as robot rights is currently being considered by for example californias institute for the future although many critics believe that the discussion is premature  the subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film plug  pray  are there limits to how intelligent machines – or human-machine hybrids – can be? a superintelligence hyperintelligence or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind ‘’superintelligence’’ may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent  if research into strong ai produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to recursive self-improvement  the new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans science fiction writer vernor vinge named this scenario singularity  technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control thus radically changing or even ending civilization because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable   ray kurzweil has used moores law which describes the relentless exponential improvement in digital technology to calculate that desktop computers will have the same processing power as human brains by the year 2029 and predicts that the singularity will occur in 2045  you awake one morning to find your brain has another lobe functioning invisible this auxiliary lobe answers your questions with information beyond the realm of your own memory suggests plausible courses of action and asks questions that help bring out relevant facts you quickly come to rely on the new lobe so much that you stop wondering how it works you just use it this is the dream of artificial intelligence robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either  this idea called transhumanism which has roots in aldous huxley and robert ettinger has been illustrated in fiction as well for example in the manga ghost in the shell and the science-fiction series dune in the 1980s artist hajime sorayamas sexy robots series were painted and published in japan depicting the actual organic human form with lifelike muscular metallic skins and later the gynoids book followed that was used by or influenced movie makers including george lucas and other creatives sorayama never considered these organic robots to be real part of nature but always unnatural product of the human mind a fantasy existing in the mind even when realized in actual form edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butlers darwin among the machines 1863 and expanded upon by george dyson in his book of the same name in 1998  thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity  the implications of a constructed machine exhibiting artificial intelligence have been a persistent theme in science fiction since the twentieth century early stories typically revolved around intelligent robots the word robot itself was coined by karel čapek in his 1921 play ru r the title standing for rossums universal robots later the sf writer isaac asimov developed the three laws of robotics which he subsequently explored in a long series of robot stories asimovs laws are often brought up during layman discussions of machine ethics  while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity  the novel do androids dream of electric sheep? by philip k dick tells a science fiction story about androids and humans clashing in a futuristic world elements of artificial intelligence include the empathy box mood organ and the androids themselves throughout the novel dick portrays the idea that human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence  nowadays ai is firmly rooted in popular culture intelligent robots appear in innumerable works hal the murderous computer in charge of the spaceship in 2001 a space odyssey 1968 is an example of the common robotic rampage archetype in science fiction movies the terminator 1984 and the matrix 1999 provide additional widely familiar examples in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still 1951 and bishop from aliens 1986 are less prominent in popular culture  see also logic machines in fiction and list of fictional computers
