applied science applied science is a discipline of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications like technology or inventions within natural science disciplines that are basic science also called pure science develop information to predict and perhaps explain—thus somehow understand—phenomena in the natural world applied science applies science to real world practice this includes a broad range of applied science related fields from engineering medicine to early childhood education applied science can also apply formal science such as statistics and probability theory as in epidemiology genetic epidemiology is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods   engineering sciences include thermodynamics heat transfer fluid mechanics statics dynamics mechanics of materials kinematics electromagnetism materials science earth sciences engineering physics medical sciences for instance medical microbiology and clinical virology are applied sciences that apply biology toward medical knowledge and inventions but not necessarily medical technology whose development is more specifically biomedicine or biomedical engineering in canada the netherlands and other places the bachelor of applied science basc is equivalent to the bachelor of engineering and is classified as a professional degree the basc tends to focus more on the application of the engineering sciences in australia and new zealand this degree is awarded in various fields of study and is considered a highly specialized professional degree in the united kingdoms educational system applied science refers to a suite of vocational science qualifications that run alongside traditional general certificate of secondary education or a-level sciences  applied science courses generally contain more coursework also known as portfolio or internally assessed work compared to their traditional counterparts these are an evolution of the gnvq qualifications that were offered up to 2005 these courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the wolf report 2011  however their merits are argued elsewhere  in the united states the college of william  mary offers an undergraduate minor as well as master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees in applied science courses and research cover varied fields including neuroscience optics materials science and engineering nondestructive testing and nuclear magnetic resonance  in new york city the bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of cornell-technion $100 million in city capital to construct the universities proposed applied sciences campus on roosevelt island
